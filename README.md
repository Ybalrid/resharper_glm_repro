Please clone this repository with `git clone --recursive` or initialize the submodule containing glm by doing `git submodule init && git submodule update`

Use CMake to generate a visual studio 2019 solution.

Open said solution with Visual Studio 2019 and Reshaper Ultimate/C++ 2019.1 installed and live analisys activated (default settings in theory).

See that code builds, but also that the linter is mad with everything using glm vectors and/or matrices
